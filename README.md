# World Temperature Interactive Dashboard

## About

This project aims to gain insights into one of the biggest threats of our age, Global Warming, by creating an interactive dashboard that visualizes complex climate change data using various Python libraries and data cleaning and transformation techniques.

## Insights

1. **Evidence of Global Warming**

   - There is evidence of temperature increase over the last centuries. The rate of change in temperature per year is around 0.00851705 °F for land and 0.00963013 °F for land and ocean.
   - This indicates that the combined land and ocean temperatures have a slightly higher rate of increase than the land temperature alone.

2. **Correlation Between Temperature Increase and Seasons**

   - The rate of change during summer months is lower than the rate of change observed in other seasons.
   - The top 3 rates of change for months suggest that climate change has more impact on colder months, indicating an increase in temperature during the winter seasons (hotter summer and colder winter).

## Data

The data used in this project is sourced from the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study and includes 1.6 billion temperature reports from 16 pre-existing archives, spanning from 1750 to 2000. This dataset provides a detailed and extensive view of historical temperature trends.

Key data points include:
- Date (Monthly)
- Land average, maximum, and minimum temperature
- Land and Ocean average temperature
- Global land temperature by cities and major cities
- Global average land temperature by countries and states

## Process

- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Utilized various techniques to clean and transform the dataset for analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Explored and conducted data analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.
- **Data Visualization**: Incorporated data visualization through libraries like Seaborn, Folium, and Plotly.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Built an interactive Python dashboard using the Panel library to visually communicate the findings.
