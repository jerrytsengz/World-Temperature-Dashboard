World Temperature Interactive Dashboard

CONCEPT

The creation of this dataset is aimed at gaining insights into one of the biggest threats of our age, Global Warming. We illustrated our findings through various Python libraries and data cleaning and transformation techniques to help us visually communicate complex climate change data.

INSIGHTS

1. According to the dataset, is there evidence of global warming? How severe is the temperature increase?

 • There is evidence of temperature increase in the last centuries. The rate of change in temperature per year is around 0.00851705 °F for land and 0.00963013 °F for land and ocean.

• This Indicates that the combined land and ocean temperatures have a slightly higher rate of increase than the land temperature.

​

2. Is there a correlation between the increase in temperature and seasons? What about months?

• The rate of change during summer months is lower than the rate of change observed in other seasons.

• Looking at the top 3 rates of change for months, we can infer that climate change has more impact on colder months, indicating an increase in temperature during the winter seasons (hotter summer and colder winter).

DATA

The data used in this project is sourced from the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study and comprises 1.6 billion temperature reports from 16 pre-existing archives, spanning from 1750 to 2000, offering a detailed and extensive view of historical temperature trends.

​

Key Data in the file include:

• Date (Monthly)

• Land average, maximum,  and minimum temperature

• Land and Ocean average temperature

• Global land temperature by cities and major cities

• Global average land temperature by countries and states

PROCESS

•  Ulitized Data cleaning and transformation techniques

• Explored and conducted data analysis using Python libraries Pandas and NumPy

• Incorporated Data visualization through libraries Seaborn, Folium, and Plotly

• Built an interactive Python dashboard through the Panel library
